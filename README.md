## Convert Flaky UI Tests to Blazing Fast APIÂ Tests

The is a short demo of converting a Selenium test to a Loadmill API test using the [har-recorder](https://github.com/loadmill/har-recorder) package.

The har-recorder npm module is using the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). (Controlled by [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface)) to capture Fatch events from Chrome.

## The converted test

The [example test](tests/my-test.js) for converstion, is a small but flaky test which creates a random post on our demo Ghost blog.
